Welcome to Part 3 of the practical sessions. This session will be an introduction to Prolog.

This practical will focus on the concepts of unification and backtracking through the use of the Prolog language.

Prolog is a logic programming language that allows us to represent knowledge bases and query the generated database. 


You can install either SWI-Prolog or GNU Prolog for these practicals.

-- Show the swipl and gprolog command

In Poliformat the files cars.pl and flights.pl are available and
contain the knowledge bases that we will use in the exercises to be carried out during the session.

Open a terminal and create a working directory where you will download and edit the programs. Invoke prolog from this directory.

Load a file by using the commands consult, compile or by putting the file name in brackets.

-- Show commands consult, compile and ()

Exercise 1:

Load the program cars using any of the previously shown load instructions, such as using brackets.

-- show code

The listing command is used to review the loaded code. It can also be used to know the definition of a particular predicate.


Exercise 2:

Execute the listing command to observe the knowledge base for the predicates model and since.

-- show outputs on each side separated by a vertical line

Important remarks: variables start by uppercase or by the underline symbol.

-- A is variable, ibiza is not

Moreover, a program is made up of a set of facts and rules.

-- show fact and rule
